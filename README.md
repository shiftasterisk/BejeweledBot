Ghoul Catchers Bot 


<h2>Steps to run</h2>
<ol>
  <li>clone the files</li>
  <li>start a new game of Ghoul Catcher that's completely visible on your primary monitor</li>
  <li>run GhoulCatchers.java</li>
</ol>

After every move the bot will move the mouse to the top left corner of the board, if you move the mouse before the next move the bot will stop.  
Do not move the location of the Ghoul Catchers board after execution as game window location calibration is only done at the initial execution of the program.
Matches are determined based off pixel detection.
